# Tasty Ten

## Project Description

Tasty Ten is aiming to be a **full-stack Next.js application** that fetches data from an **external API** to display a curated list of 10 random favorite recipes.

This project leverages **Next.js API routes** (`pages/api/handleData.js`) to create a **custom backend**, enabling seamless data fetching and server-side processing.

It combines **React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and React-Bootstrap** to deliver a dynamic and user-friendly interface.  
With just one click, users can generate and explore recipe suggestions—perfect for busy individuals looking for quick meal ideas.
